This year, 2020, the world economy as a guaranto of wealth is going to get damaged.
Currently the 'experts' have a huge spread of future predictions.

That is why I created this project.

It's purpose is to deliver people with the needed goods and services without the need to buy with money.

Easyly list down the things you are searching for and do the same with things you can offer therefore.
If there is another user, offering the things you search and searching what your offer, you guessed it, it will show you the possible deal.

Often these kind of deals aren't possible.
The following constellation is more common:
A needs Potatoes and offers Water
B needs Strawberries and offers Potatoes
C needs Water and offers Strawberries

Being not easy to be calculated this kind of deal is easy to calculate for a computer.
